# CAD2019
Cad for 2019

General Information:
	We will have a discussion about proper file names. We're doing it better this year.
	
	The main robot file is "2019RobotChassis," it's in this folder so it should be easy to see.

Github Information:
	Check your gitignore file, and if it has nothing in it, but "~$*" in it.
